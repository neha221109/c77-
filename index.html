    <p> The console. log() is a function that writes a message to log on the debugging console, such as Webkit or
        Firebug. In a browser you will not see anything on the screen. It logs a message to a debugging console. It is
        only available in Firefox with Firebug and in Webkit based browsers (Chrome and Safari)</p>
